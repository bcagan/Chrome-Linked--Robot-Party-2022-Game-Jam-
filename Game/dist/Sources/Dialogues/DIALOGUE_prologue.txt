4 0 Gil: You are and might I say a high paying one. 
4 0 Gil: Let’s just say that so-called “resistance” has obtained some highly confidential information from us. I need to you to take care of the “mole”, so to speak.

4 0 Gil: Simple, the Resistance is planning an attack on our HQ.

3 0 Ziv: And… when will I know who this target is?
3 0 Ziv: Normally an assassin is told who they are going to assassinate before they assassinate them.
4 0 Gil: Oh, you will know. I will check back in once you finish you assisining, or assassinating, or whatever you call it...
