2 1 Terran: And your new INTELLIGENT-US should be loaded Av-I mean, Gigantus
2 1 Terran: Now-
1 1 *Ziv jumps up on to a metal beam near Terran*
2 1 Terran: Wh…who are you?
0 1 ???: ...
1 1 *Explosions*
4 2 Gil, the Boss of Envocron (creator of the new wave of mechs based on Gigantus)
4 2 Gil: Long time no see Ziv, or should I say long time no talk’d
3 2 Ziv: ...
4 2 Gil: Gaha, just a small little quip
3 2 Ziv: *sighs* Let’s get this over with. You said I was here for a contract. Who is it?
4 2 Gil: You are and might I say a high paying one. 
4 2 Gil: Let’s just say that so-called “resistance” has obtained some highly confidential information from us. I need to you to take care of the “mole”, so to speak.
3 2 Ziv: You know I don’t want to get involved with that anymore. 
3 2 Ziv: And besides, didn’t you base your technology off their own invention?
4 2 Gil: ...
4 2 Gil: GAHAHAHA! Ziv, you’re quick-witted as always. 
4 2 Gil: Listen, I knew you’d be hesitant, but may I remind you that we promised over 1000000 E for this job.
3 2 Ziv: ...
3 2 Ziv: Just tell me what I need to do
4 2 Gil: Simple, the Resistance is planning an attack on our HQ. 
4 2 Gil: We have our own people ready to defend, but if you want to get your target, you’re going to need to get in there before anyone else.
3 2 Ziv: And… when will I know who this target is?
3 2 Ziv: Normally an assassin is told who they are going to assassinate before they assassinate them.
4 2 Gil: Oh, you will know. I will check back in once you finish you assisining, or assassinating, or whatever you call it... 
4 2 Gil: *belly laughing* GAHAHA
1 2 *click*
3 2 Ziv: Still insufferable...
