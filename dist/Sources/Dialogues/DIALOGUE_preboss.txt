1 0 Mysterious Voice: I did not expect Envocron to send anyone so soon. State your name.
0 0 Ziv: Wait I recognize that voice… Jebb? But I thought I killed you.. t..twice.
1 0 *EXPOLOSIONS*
3 0 Terran : *cough* Z…Ziv… is... is that you?
1 0 *EXPLOSIONS*
3 0 Terran: Wh…who?
3 0 Terran: Jebb O'Shenny? But *cough* but I thought you were dead.
1 0 *ZAPPER SHOT*
3 0 Terran: Gah!
0 0 Ziv: N-
2 0 Jebb: Silence!
2 0 Jebb: …Ziv? I could say the same to you as well… well once at least.
0 0 Ziv: Bastard, first you killed my brother and then you framed me for both of our "deaths".
0 0 Ziv: What are you even doing with the resistance after killing their "prodigy".

0 0 Ziv: I'd never help the likes of you!
2 0 Jebb: I didn't think you’d listen to reason. If you won’t join us, I guess I'll have to stop you from getting in our way.
